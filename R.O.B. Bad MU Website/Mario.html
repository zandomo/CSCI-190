        <p><Strong>Neutral</Strong></p>
            <p>Mario is very threatening up close because of his fast normals and grabs that can true combo into a large damage dealing combos or sometimes even death. Staying grounded against Mario is going to be the way to play him in neutral because the risk reward to try to anti air him is never worth it. For this reason, I like to keep gyro on the ground to serve as an active hitbox for him to have to jump over or try to reflect, both moves that we can punish respectively. Unfortunately, this is another character with a reflector so we can't be too trigger happy when it comes to shooting our projectiles. The only ranged game Mario can play is with fireball, and lots of times Mario players will jump fireball and drift behind it so when you shield the projectile, they are up in your face. To counter this, you can just fair him upon reaction of seeing him in the air. Fair will be your best friend for preventing him to keep mindlessly mashing on you. Alongside this, charging gyro a lot to bait his reflector full screen can also be good to mixup when you are going to shoot it. Same goes for edgeguarding. Cape halts all their momentum so if you keep shooting projectiles at them, it is a committment for them to try to reflect offstage, so you can just bait it and try to dair their now more linear recovery. </p>

            <p><strong>Disadvantage:</strong></p>
            <p>Mario, like the other characters mentioned, is very hard for us because of how good their advantage state is. It is very easy for them to use a rising up or or falling bair (which is safe on block) which can easily be converted into a combo, especially since R.O.B. is big. When you do get hit by one of these moves, be careful of airdodging unnecessarily as mario can easily track you down and continue swinging. Make sure you DI away from the platforms so that he cannot keep laddering you higher and higher to the blast zone. On ledge, be careful of the flowchart back air spam as well as the grabs that could combo into bair for a kill. His only killing throw is back throw, so just look out for being too predictable with neutral getup. </p>
