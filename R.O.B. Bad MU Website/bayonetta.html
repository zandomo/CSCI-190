<title>Bayonetta</title>

<p><strong>Neutral:</strong></p>
<p>The basic gameplan is to sit in shield and punish bayo for throwing out any hitboxes. Down tilt is very good in this mu because they can't do much about it besides trying to up b out of shield, but you can pull up shield before
    them and just fair them after playing the rps. Make sure to punish any hard landing lag that bayo will be in, but be careful of swinging too soon because they typically would counter or throw out a down air as a last resort. If you
    realize that they are out of resources and are near the ledge, there is a high chance they will airdodge to ledge, so be ready for that. I recommend charging gyro a lot in neutral to threaten both the grounded and aerial space, and
    it being charged becomes a lot more effective for edgeguarding and shooting in neutral as well.

<p><strong>Things To Look Out For:</strong></p>
<p>The biggest thing you will want to look out for is ABK. It will hit R.O.B. if he is standing up right, so position yourself to be right where Bayo will be after using ABK and duck. If you suspect a Bayo to ABK, then duck and upon
reaction whiff punish them with up tilt. If you do not have the time to do so, just pull up shield

<p><strong>Edgeguarding:</strong></p>
<p>Try not to go offstage against Bayo because their entire goal is to keep hitting us offstage until we die/run out of fuel. Shooting laser and gyro are your best bets to snipe them since up b and side b have linear movements, but if
they try to go to ledge, you can back air, down tilt or downwards angled f tilt for the kill. This is best when they are riding the stage and intend to grab ledge with up b since it does not snap to ledge.
</p>

<p><strong>MU Knowledge:</strong></p>
<p>Versus Bayo, be careful of leaving gyro on the ground because it is easy for them to witch time it which not only gives them access to gyro, but it slows down R.O.B. as well.
