            <p><strong>Neutral:</strong></p>
            <p>Mr. Game and Watch's main neutral options are going to be short hop nair and dash grab (which combos into short hop nair). What makes this matchup so hard is the fact that Game and Watch is very oppressive up close, and we cannot play the range game due to his down b being able to absorb our laser and reflect our gyro.  Not to mention his nair is very disjointed so he will win the air to air battle a majority of the time. This is why I would recommend playing grounded against Mr. Game and Watch for the most part. To beat his nairs, you can space outside of them and swat him with a fair or nair of your own. At higher percents, you can throw out short hop bairs looking for the kill, just don't be too predictable as to when you put yourself in the air. Catching his landings can be hard, but look for up tilts because he is very light and has the potential to die to up air very early if their DI is bad

            <p><strong>Disadvantage:</strong></p>
            <p>Once Mr. Game and Watch starts to get underneath you and hits you with an up air, landing becomes very hard because they can repeatedly use that move to combo into itself. Since R.O.B. is a big character, it makes landing very hard. Landing aggressively also is a bad option because of his frame 4 up b out of shield. The first step is to get out from underneath of him and try to land on a platform or the ground as soon as possible so he can't repeatedly hit you. You can mix up your landings by using up b to hover above his hitboxes and then quickly land once you see a gap in the attacks. As for being edgeguarded, your best bet is to either ride the stage or go high because his back air will catch you a majority of the time when trying to recover from the 225 or 315 degree angle. I would also recommend going high because Mr. Game and Watch has one of the best ledgetrapping tools in the game with chef, and flying past ledge let's you skip this aspect of the game.

            <p><strong>MU Knowledge:</strong></p>
            <p>Mr. Game and Watch players are predictable in the sense that they like to abuse all their good options, but can be predictable when doing so. Out of disadvantage, GnW players like to use down air a lot to put out a strong hitbox that simultaneously gets them to the ground quickly. To avoid this, you can either hit them before they get their move out or shield and up smash them oos if you notice them using it too close to the ground. The better players will use it from up above so it autocancels which is when things get tricky, but as a safe alternative which works for all situations, you can dash back and shoot your gyro to whiff punish them without directly being in harm. Mr. Game and Watch players are also very trigger happy when it comes to using up b oos since it is one of the fastest oos options in the game. R.O.B. players land on people with nair a lot, so when GnW players see rob landing on them, they expect them to land with an aggresive option. You can bait an up b oos by emptyhop shielding and then true punishing their up b with an up air. I wouldn't recommend tomahawking just because of how fast their up b is, but depending on the player it might be good to condition them with it before you start empty hop shielding too much.
